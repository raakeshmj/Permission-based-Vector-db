Internal Engineering and Development Guidelines

This document is intended for developers working on internal systems
and software platforms within the organization.

System Architecture:
The company uses a microservices-based architecture deployed on cloud
infrastructure. Services communicate via REST APIs and message queues.
Authentication is handled through centralized identity services.

Development Workflow:
All code changes must be made through feature branches and submitted
via pull requests. Each pull request requires at least one peer review
before being merged into the main branch.

API Usage:
Internal APIs are documented using OpenAPI specifications. Developers
should avoid breaking changes and follow versioning conventions when
modifying existing endpoints.

Data Handling:
Developers may access development and staging databases but must not
directly access production data unless explicitly authorized. Sensitive
fields such as user credentials and financial records must be handled
according to security guidelines.

Deployment:
CI/CD pipelines automatically run tests and security scans before
deployment. Manual deployments to production are restricted to senior
developers and managers.
